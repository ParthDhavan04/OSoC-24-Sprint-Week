With Flutter Firebase, you can easily integrate Firebase Realtime Database into your Flutter app and manage real-time data updates.\n\nCloud Firestore: Firebase Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable NoSQL database for mobile, web, and server development. Flutter Firebase provides seamless integration with Cloud Firestore, allowing you to store and query structured data in your Flutter app.\n\nCloud Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage provides a secure and scalable solution for storing and serving user-generated content such as images, videos, and files. With Flutter Firebase, you can easily upload, download, and manage files in Firebase Cloud Storage.\n\nRemote Config: Firebase Remote Config allows you to remotely configure and customize your app without requiring users to update the app. With Flutter Firebase, you can easily use Remote Config to define and deploy parameters that can be changed in real time.\n\nFunctionality of Flutter Maps:\nMap Display: Flutter Maps provides a variety of map display options, including interactive maps, static maps, and custom map styles. You can integrate popular map providers like Google Maps, Mapbox, and OpenStreetMap into your Flutter app.\n\nMarkers and Overlays: Flutter Maps allows you to add markers, overlays, and other visual elements to the map. You can display custom icons, info windows, polygons, polylines, and more to enhance the user experience.\n\nUser Location: Flutter Maps provides functionality to access and display the user's current location on the map. You can track the user's location in real time and display it as a marker or update the map view accordingly.\n\nGeocoding and Reverse Geocoding: Flutter Maps supports geocoding and reverse geocoding, which allows you to convert addresses or place names into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and vice versa. This enables you to search for locations, display addresses on the map, and perform location-based queries.\n\nRouting and Directions: Flutter Maps provides routing and directions functionality, allowing you to calculate and display routes between multiple locations. You can show turn-by-turn directions, estimated travel times, and alternative routes on the map.\n\nGestures and Interactions: Flutter Maps supports various gestures and interactions, such as panning, zooming, rotation, and tilt. Users can interact with the map using touch gestures to explore and navigate the map view."},

For Hacktoberfest see .md filesAbout the Project\nIt is noticed that whenever we lose something on campus, we have to run to the Lost and Found department and look for it there, and at times the item reaches there after we have already visited it once. Hence, an app would be helpful to provide information about this. It will be simple and elegantly designed. There will be a login page, and then there will be two options to choose from: find a lost item or report an item that is found and belongs to someone else. Then there will be multiple options to choose from, including basic items such as ID Cards, Mobile Phones, wallets, ATM cards, notebooks, and others. If someone has to report a found item, they can either select identifiable or anonymous, or else they can submit it to the lost and found department and tell the owner to claim it from there. The owner can prove their identity and claim the item.
