# Issue 22: Github's daily counter

## Problem Statement

Github's daily counter can be used as a writing space. Create a program in any language of your choice that will tell which days the user should contribute in order to get the given text. 
Example: https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQGI-DaooArBUSm79iD-lT7znAa8QjtKunNow&usqp=CAU

Hint- use a matrix and fill the fields that are occupied, then convert the coordinate position into calendar dates using linear traversal
